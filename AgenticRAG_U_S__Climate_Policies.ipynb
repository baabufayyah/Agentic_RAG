            "The U.S. climate policies encompass a range of initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing climate resilience, and promoting clean energy. Key policies include the President's Climate Action Plan (2013), which focuses on cutting carbon pollution, preparing for climate impacts, and leading international efforts. The 2021 Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis aims for carbon neutrality by 2050 and establishes various task forces to address climate-related issues. The U.S. Climate Finance Plan (2021) seeks to double public climate finance to developing countries and triple adaptation finance by 2024. Additionally, the Long-Term Strategy outlines five transformations to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, including decarbonizing electricity and reducing methane emissions. The State and Local Climate and Energy Program supports states in developing energy efficiency and renewable energy policies. Overall, these policies reflect a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change through mitigation, adaptation, and international cooperation.\n"
